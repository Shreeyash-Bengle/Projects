GENERALISED DATA STRUCTURE LIBRARY (GDSL)

TECHNOLOGY : C++ Programming

PROJECT OVERVIEW
• This project is a C++ library of generic data structures that provides object-oriented implementations of both linear and non-linear data structures.

• It offers ready-to-use functionalities for fundamental as well as advanced operations, designed in a generic way using templates so that they can be reused with any data type.

• The library is designed to support clean OOP principles, modularity, and extensibility making it suitable for both academic learning and real-world application development.

KEY FEATURES

1. Linear Data Structures

   • Singly Linear Linked List

   • Singly Circular Linked List

   • Doubly Linear Linked List

   • Doubly Circular Linked List

   • Stack (LIFO)

   • Queue (FIFO)

2. Non-Linear Data Structures

   • Binary Search Tree (BST) with insert, delete, traversal operations

3. Generic Implementation

   • Uses C++ templates for data type independence.

   • Same implementation works for integers, floats, strings, and custom objects.

4. Library Format

   • Designed as a reusable C++ library that can be linked with client applications.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
• Mastery of C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
Strong foundation in linear and non-linear data structures.
• Implementation of generic programming with templates.
• Practical knowledge of searching and sorting algorithms.
• Experience in designing reusable libraries for software development.
